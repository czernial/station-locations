# Station Locations Exercise
Atlassian practice exercise of using git: [link](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/learn-git-with-bitbucket-cloud)

1. Create Git repository online
    - create new repository on Github. I added a `readme.md` in the setup which Atlassian doesn't do.

2. Clone new git repository to computer
    - made new directory on computer  
    `$ mkdir repos`
    - copied git repository to new directory
